# Dev jobs handlebars

Job seeking / posting app like linkedin.

This is the repository for my attempt of translating the course app to NextJS(which is my favorite frontend framework).

# API dependency

For now this app uses 'dev-jobs-handlebars' as backend.

It's too much of a hassle to unify the backend or do something to change this, so for now it will be like this.

Fast setup:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:FelixRiddle/dev-jobs.git && cd dev-jobs && npm run install && npm run dev
```

That's just the server, we need trix

Open new shell at project root and run
TODO: Fast setup

```bash
cd public/package/trix@2.1.1 && 
```

# Dotenv

```bash
# Defaults to 3005(dev-jobs-handlebars repository)
API_PORT=
```
